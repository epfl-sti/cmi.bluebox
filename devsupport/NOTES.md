2015-02-09 - Blue Box personalization use case
================================================

To be transcribed into ../README.md at some point. DRAFT STATE - There may be a way to suppress step 

1. The VPN operator procures a Blue Box and installs a standard OpenWRT image onto it.
2. The VPN operator configures network access on the Blue box
3. The VPN operator access the NOC and logs into the Web UI
4. Using the Web UI, the VPN operator creates a new Blue Box and is prompted the following information:
   * hostname of the Blue Box (must be unique)
   * VPN to insert the Blue Box into
5. The NOC prepares a .tgz file ready for uploading through the Blue Box's "backup/restore" Web UI. The .tgz contains either files (e.g. `/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys`), or scripts (e.g. `/etc/rc.local`, `/etc/hotplug.d/iface/br-wan`) that together will effect the following configuration changes inside the target Blue Box:
   * the hostname is set as per the information requested at step 4
   * The VPN's public SSH key will become authorized to access as root
   * Access to SSH with a password will be disabled (only the aforementioned public key can access)
   * The firewall configuration will be updated to allow access to port 22 (SSH) through the Blue Box's WAN interface
   * Upon every successful configuration of the Blue Box's WAN interface, and periodically thereafter unless the Tinc VPN is up (at step 11 below), the Blue Box will send an unauthenticated HTTP request to the NOC containing its WAN-side IPv4 address, VPN name, and a cryptographic token identifying the tar.gz that was built
6. The VPN operator downloads the .tgz file of Step 5 and uploads it through the Blue Box's Web restore interface. There are two modes of operation for this: either download to administrator's browser / upload from same, or by cutting/pasting a companion shell one-liner into the /etc/rc.local script (http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/startup , bottom of the page) and rebooting.
   * To prevent replay attacks, either of these downloads is only feasible once, and the URL contains a token that only the administrator can get access to. If the step fails, the tar.gz needs to be recreated.
7. The Blue Box reboots and applies the requested changes. Because a restore performed from an incomplete .tgz "backup" (crafted as per point 5) only overlays the files in the .tgz and doesn't wipe out the rest of the configuration, the rest of the Blue Box's pre-existing configuration (in particular, its network parameters) stay unchanged.
8. The Blue Box starts accessing the NOC over the aforementioned unauthenticated HTTP request.
9. The NOC responds to these HTTP pings by ssh'ing into the Blue Box automatically, and performing the following changes:
   * a keypair is generated for tinc, unless already present
   * the tinc configuration (in particular, the public key exchange) is carried out and tinc is set up to start automatically at boot, and is started at once
   * the vpn0 interface (the one that tinc creates) is bridged into br-lan
10. The Blue Box reboots to apply the changes and joins the tinc VPN.
11. Upon successfully joining the VPN for the first time, the Blue Box fences the HTTP pings (condition on whether the VPN is up in the ping script). It resumes pinging if the connectivity drops.
12. The NOC figures out from the tincd logs that the Blue Box joined the VPN successfully, and thereafter periodically ssh's into the Blue Box (over its WAN-side IP address) to collect statistics.

The administrator is also able to trigger steps 9 and 12 manually, by entering the WAN-side IP address of an existing but yet unconfigured / unresponding Blue Box.

2015-02-08 - Installing Tinc on Mac OS X Yosemite
=====================================================

With the Yosemite release, Apple appears to have [changed its policy](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/31164) regarding signing kernel extensions (kexts). The following is now required to get TUN/TAP working (which is in turn necessary to run tinc on your Mac laptop for tests):

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if not already done
2. ``sudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local /Library/Caches/Homebrew`` â€“ Just in case you [mistakenly](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/150271/how-to-repair-homebrew-permissions-after-installing-as-root) `brew install`'d something as root at some point...
3. <pre>
    brew update
    brew unlink brew-cask
    brew install Caskroom/cask/tuntap
    </pre>
4. `kextstat | grep tuntaposx`

2015-02-08 - Desired tinc configuration
===========================================

```
root@cmibb2:~# cat /etc/tinc/CMi_Lausanne_Centrotherm/tinc.conf
name = cmibb2
mode = switch
ConnectTo = cmigevm1
interface = vpn0
```

```
quatrava@cmigevm1:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/tinc start
Starting tinc daemons: CMi_Lausanne_Centrotherm.
quatrava@cmigevm1:~$ cat /etc/tinc/CMi_Lausanne_Centrotherm/tinc.conf 
Name = cmigevm1
Mode = switch
```

```
quatrava@cmigevm1:~$ cat /etc/tinc/CMi_Lausanne_Centrotherm/hosts/cmigevm1 
Address = cmigevm1.epfl.ch


-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
...
```

```
quatrava@cmigevm1:~$ sudo cat /etc/tinc/CMi_Lausanne_Centrotherm/hosts/cmibb2 

-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
...
```

Note: The contents of `/etc/tinc/CMi_Lausanne_Centrotherm/hosts` is the same on all members of the tinc mesh.
